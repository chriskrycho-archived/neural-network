# Neural Network model

This model uses stepwise iteration with Euler method to model neural network
function. It is (loosely) based on the work of the Zochowski group at The
University of Michigan. Nothing of this is represented to "work" in a meaningful
sense; it is preserved *solely* for the historical interest of the author.
